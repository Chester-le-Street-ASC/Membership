It was always going to hurt and you\u2019ve just got to fight it!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There were two Brits on the podium in the Men\u2019s 200m Medley as Tom Dean (01:59.55) and Max Litchfield (02:01.34) earned silver and bronze.

I\u2019m really looking forward to Worlds in a few weeks now \u2013 to do that time, when I\u2019m nowhere near tapered, is really good.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn fact, before I came out here, I was saying to my coach how nervous I was, because I knew how hard this competition was going to be because I knew how much training we had done. I\u2019m looking forward to swimming my main event in Barcelona now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The final leg of the Mare Nostrum Swim Series will take place in Barcelona on 15 and 16 June.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>British swimmers had a successful second day in the Canet leg of the Mare Nostrum Swim Series, winning five gold medals, two silver and two bronze.
