# Membership
Membership, a new project from [Chester-le-Street ASC](https://www.chesterlestreetasc.co.uk/) aims to make swimming club management simpler. It is available under the Apache open-source license, so you are free to use our code in any way possible.

This product is still under active development, and will launch in the future. We have however launched trials with some of our members, using release v0.2.

If you install this application on your own server, you must set up the SQL database tables yourself. You will need to modify the `config-template.php` file to connect to your database and rename it `config.php`.

Chester-le-Street ASC accept no liability for any issues, including all legal issues, with this pre-release software.

## Features
### Automatic Member Management
The application is built on a database of club members. Members are assigned to squads and parents can link swimmers to their account. This allows us to automatically calculate monthly fees and other things.

### Online Gala Entries
Galas are added to the system by admins. Parents can enter their children into swims by selecting their name, gala and swims. This cuts down on duplicated data from existing arrangements. Parents recieve emails detailing their entries.

### Online Attendance Records
Attendance records are online, facilitating automatic attendance calculation.
