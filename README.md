# Membership
Membership, a new project from Chester-le-Street ASC aims to make swimming club management simpler. It is not currently available under an open-source license, though will eventually be.

This product is still under active development, and will launch in the future.

If you install this application on your own server, you must set up the SQL database tables yourself. Functions are currently held in a file which is ignored by git, meaning that they will not work.

Chester-le-Street ASC accept no liability for any issues, including all legal issues, with this pre-release software.

## Features
### Automatic Member Management
The application is built on a database of club members. Members are assigned to squads and parents can link swimmers to their account. This allows us to automatically calculate monthly fees and other things.

### Online Gala Entries
Galas are added to the system by admins. Parents can enter their children into swims by selecting their name, gala and swims. This cuts down on duplicated data from existing arrangements. Parents recieve emails detailing their entries.

### Online Attendance Records
Attendance records are online, facilitating automatic attendance calculation.
